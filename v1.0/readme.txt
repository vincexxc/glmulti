This folder contains the java sources from which the java classes (.class bytecode files) used in the R package glmulti v1.x are compiled.
The java code is called from the R code only, using the rJava interface.
The R package itself can be installed from CRAN.
CAUTION: modifying these files might compromise the functioning of the R package, do this only if you know what you are doing.
